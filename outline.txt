Title of Project?
- Implementing a local filesystem API for remote dropbox file operations

- Abstract
- Introduction
	- Background: Parrot
- Description of module
	- File descriptor table
	- Directory mechanism
	- Authorization
		- Register on Dropbox
		- Janky splinter code to automate logging in
	- Object oriented design
	- Supports all basic filesystem operations
	- Only connecting points  to remote servers are in upload (whose position is determined by upload strategy) and in download (in open())
	- Clutter-prevention mechanism for local filesystem
- Description of data gathering step
	- 3 different strategies for uploading
- Testing mechanisms
	- Many different test scenarios
	- Different functions within the module for different modes
	- Testing across various sizes
- Findings
	- Graphs
	- Description of various test scenarios
	- Comparison to two other vendors (box and google drive)
- Conclusions
	- To be determined
- Discussion
	- Challenges: automatic authorization
